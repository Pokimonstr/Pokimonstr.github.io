    <p class="main-text">the song is about swapping places with another person in an attempt to understand things from their perspective... It's about a relationship between a man and a woman. They love each other very much, and the power of the relationship is something that gets in the way. It creates insecurities... It's saying, if the man could be the woman and the woman the man, if they could <b>make a deal with God</b>, to change places, that they'd understand what it's like to be the other person and perhaps it would clear up misunderstandings. You know, all the little problems; there would be no problem...” </p>
